A tremendously enthusiastic person, passionate about making and doing things that
improve people's lives. Gained a ton of experience in a highly demanding fast-paced environment during my 8 years at Amazon
before giving up all the lovely shares to learn to make things with code at
Makers Academy. I'm looking for a challenging junior development position where
I can keep learning while adding value. 


## Skills

#### Experimental
I greatly enjoy trying new things. 

I re-discovered development when I solved an issue we were having removing
non-relevant content from our training material prior to sending for
translation. By talking with our localization engineer and teaching myself about
macros I was able to set up a process which enabled us to accurately scope
localization effort (wordcount) and made it easy to mark content as being not
for translation. 

When developing our "Second Guessing" app none of us had used audio previously
and during our research stage I set up a sandbox to experiment with playing
audio on our front-end and how to set the time limits on the playing function. 

I've recently purchased an Arduino starter kit and have greatly enjoyed playing
with this. I've successfully created the world's worst theremin and am in
the process of learning
how to turn this into a Jean-Michel Jarre style keyboard.

#### Long Term Thinking
  I've been through the pain of doing things fast and then trying to scale.
Through first-hand experience at Amazon I understand the importance of building things
that are extendable and reusable. Being able to weigh up short-term gains versus
long-term value. 

#### Innovation
  I enjoy coming up with and developing ideas.
  Whilst at Amazon I was shortlisted for the Big Ideas competition in my final two
  years. The ideas submitted were based on improving resources for
  Customer Service Agents to be able to improve customer satisfaction.

  During my time at Makers we held open pitch sessions to decide what apps to
make as our final two projects. I had three of my app ideas chosen by the group
to turn into functioning
  products. I get an enormous sense of satisfaction from pitching ideas and seeing
  them come to fruition.

#### Managing Complex Projects
  As global Instructional Design (ID) Project Manager for multiple large-scale launches including the new Amazon Fire tablet launch training, I supported the ID team in creation of global single source learning objects for 3000+ learners in 10 marketplaces including 7 languages.

  As global ID Program Manager for Amazon Mayday, led cross-functional team in redesign of training materials based on quantitative and qualitative data. Estimated savings from the project were $250,000USD based on learners' reduced time to competency and improved customer satisfaction results.
