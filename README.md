Instructional Designer turned Junior Developer via Makers Academy bootcamp. Looking for an opportunity to utilise my experience at Amazon in a high-pressure, fast-moving, delivery-focused environment, to now create test-driven, clean code and continue my journey to becoming a Software Craftsman.


## Skills

#### Curiosity
  I love to learn how things work and investigate different approaches. To solve an issue in a localisation process I learned to write macros and created an automated solution. For our final project in Makers we delivered a completed product in 2 weeks using the Ionic framework which we had never used before. 

#### Prioritisation/Time Management 
  When managing intake of Digital Instructional Design projects I’d need to quickly assess severity and impact of projects to assign resources. I’d frequently own multiple new projects at one time while continuing maintenance work on existing curricula..

#### Innovation
  I enjoy coming up with and developing ideas.
  Whilst at Amazon I was shortlisted for the Big Ideas competition in my final two
  years. The ideas submitted were based on improving resources for
  Customer Service Agents to be able to improve customer satisfaction.

  During my time at Makers we held open pitch sessions to decide what apps to
make as our final two projects. I had three of my app ideas chosen by the group
to turn into functioning
  products. I get an enormous sense of satisfaction from pitching ideas and seeing
  them come to fruition.
  
#### Strong Communicator 
From dealing directly with customers to negotiating training timelines with Directors I’ve gained experience in being an effective communicator. At Makers Academy bootcamp I’ve learned to clearly communicate ideas with my pair programming partner and intent through clearly written code.

#### Managing Complex Projects
  As global Instructional Design (ID) Project Manager for multiple large-scale launches including the new Amazon Fire tablet launch training, I supported the ID team in creation of global single source learning objects for 3000+ learners in 10 marketplaces including 7 languages.

  As global ID Program Manager for Amazon Mayday, led cross-functional team in redesign of training materials based on quantitative and qualitative data. Estimated savings from the project were $250,000USD based on learners' reduced time to competency and improved customer satisfaction results.
